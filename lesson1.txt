It allowed me to see what lines had changed which led 
finding the error faster

Easy access to the entire history allows the programmer 
to easily find errors and allows you to revert if you 
would like to change back to the older version 

Pros of manually committing 
+Allows for specific logical commit points 
+Reduces number of commits 
+Makes it easier to check changes 

Cons 
-May lose some data if there is a power outage or some other unexpected event 
-It is usually not clear when one must commit as it is a 
judgement call

Pros of automatically saving 
+Will have data even if unexpected event occurs 
+Takes away the need for the user to have to manually commit 

Cons 
-Clutter of data when checking changes 
-Data committed may be unnecessary  (too big / too small)


Git allows for saving multiple files due to the fact that files may be interdependent 
on each other. 

Git log  - can be used to check all commits dates and the message related
Git diff - can be used to check difference between two commits
